# Search-Engine
A search engine can be used for information extraction. We have proposed a system which retrieves the results having titles of academic conference papers and other useful information based on the keyword searched. In this project, we tried to implement few basic features that included Indexing, Searching with some additional features like Highlighting and SpellCheck. Moreover, features like PageRanking, Word2vec, DOc2vec, TF-IDF and Autosuggestion were also included as a part of this project. Further to enhance the search engine, classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine and also clustering algorithm like K- Means have been implemented.Finally, feature selection techniques like term-frequency vectorizer and chi squared from scikit has been applied. The implementation has been done on four datasets that included conference papers from multiple resources. The mentioned features are implemented using Java Lucene library and other Python libraries. The proposed system is deployed on localhost using Apache Tomcat Server.
